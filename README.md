# Gaming Test
1. Set up an object which represents a `PlayingField`. A playing field will contain
information about which points are present in the game.
2. Set up an object which represents a `Point`. Each point will come with a direction. Each
point must also be associated with a playing field.
3. For each point, define a method which calculates the set of other points which are inside
the field of vision.
4. Test whether it works or not. Can have a `.txt` file with each of the point locations
and directions inside.
